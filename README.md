# Introduction

This code is for the experiments related to RML Reward Machines.

# Instructions

To run RML reward Machines, RML needs to be installed on your machine and run with a weboscket connection. The monitors required to perform the task can be found under rml/rml_monitors. The specifications can be found under rml/rml_specifcations.

The letterenv_numerical_demo.py file runs the numerical experiment. To recreate the graph use plot_numerical_experiment_final.py under the results folder. To recreate the graph for the conditional experiment run storage_parameters_graph.py.
